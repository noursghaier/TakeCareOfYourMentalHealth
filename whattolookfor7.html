          <h1> Personality Disorders </h1>
          <br>
          <p>      
                People with personality disorders experience patterns of behavior, feelings, and thinking that can:
            

              <ul >
                  <li>Interfere with a personâ€™s life</li>
                  <li>Create problems at work and school</li>
                  <li>Cause issues in personal and social relationships</li>
              </ul>

        </p>   
        <p>
                Personality disorders include:
            <ul>
                <li><b><a href="#Antisocial"> Antisocial Personality Disorder    </a></b></li>
                <li><b><a href="#Borderline"> Borderline Personality Disorder    </a></b></li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2 id="Antisocial"> Antisocial Personality Disorder   </h2>
        <p>
                Antisocial personality disorder is a mental health condition in which a person has a long-term pattern of manipulating, exploiting, or violating the rights of others. This behavior is often criminal.
                
        </p>
        <h3>Causes</h3>
        <p>Cause of antisocial personality disorder is unknown. Genetic factors and environmental factors, such as child abuse, are believed to contribute to the development of this condition. People with an antisocial or alcoholic parent are at increased risk. Far more men than women are affected. The condition is common among people who are in prison.</p>
         <p>Fire-setting and cruelty to animals during childhood are linked to the development of antisocial personality.</p>
         <p>Some doctors believe that psychopathic personality (psychopathy) is the same disorder. Others believe that psychopathic personality is a similar but more severe disorder.</p>
        
        <h3>Symptoms</h3> 
        <p>
                A person with antisocial personality disorder may:
               <ul>
                <li>Be able to act witty and charming</li>
                <li>Be good at flattery and manipulating other people's emotions</li>
                <li>Break the law repeatedly</li>
                <li>Disregard the safety of self and others</li>
                <li>Have problems with substance abuse</li>
                <li>Lie, steal, and fight often</li>
                <li>Not show guilt or remorse</li>
                <li>Often be angry or arrogant</li>

               </ul>

        </p>
        <h2 id="Borderline">Borderline Personality Disorder</h2>
        <p>Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a mental health condition in which a person has long-term patterns of unstable or turbulent emotions. These inner experiences often result in impulsive actions and chaotic relationships with other people.</p>
        <h3>Causes</h3>
        <p>Cause of borderline personality disorder is unknown. Genetic, family, and social factors are thought to play roles.</p>    
        <p>
                Risk factors for BPD include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Abandonment in childhood or adolescence</li>
                    <li>Disrupted family life</li>
                    <li>Poor communication in the family</li>
                    <li>Sexual, physical, or emotional abuse</li>
                </ul>
                This personality disorder tends to occur more often in women and among hospitalized psychiatric patients.
        </p>
      <h3>Symptoms</h3>
      <p>Persons with BPD are often uncertain about their identity. As a result, their interests and values can change rapidly. They also tend to view things in terms of extremes, such as either all good or all bad. Their views of other people can change quickly. A person who is looked up to one day may be looked down on the next day. These suddenly shifting feelings often lead to intense and unstable relationships.</p>
    <p>
            Other symptoms of BPD include:
            <ul>
               <li>Intense fear of being abandoned</li>
               <li>Cannot tolerate being alone</li>
               <li>Frequent feelings of emptiness and boredom</li>
               <li>Frequent displays of inappropriate anger</li>
               <li>Impulsiveness, such as with substance abuse or sexual relationships</li>
               <li>Repeated crises and acts of self-injury, such as wrist cutting or overdosing</li>

            </ul>   

    </p>
    <h3>Exams and Tests</h3>
    <p>BPD is diagnosed based on a psychological evaluation that assesses the history and severity of the symptoms.</p>
    <h3>Treatment</h3>
    <p>
            Individual talk therapy may successfully treat BPD. In addition, group therapy can sometimes be helpful.
      <br><br>
      Medications have less of a role in the treatment of BPD. But in some cases, they can improve mood swings and treat depression or other disorders that may occur with this condition.
    </p>
    <h3>Outlook (Prognosis)</h3>
    <p>Outlook of treatment depends on how severe the condition is and whether the person is willing to accept help. With long-term talk therapy, the person often gradually improves.</p>
    <h3>Possible Complications</h3>
       <p>
           <ul>
                <li>  Depression    </li>
                <li>  Drug abuse   </li>
                <li>  Problems with work, family, and social relationships  </li>
                <li> Suicide attempts and actual suicide</li>
           </ul>
       </p>
       <h3>When to Contact a Medical Professional</h3>
       <p>See your health care provider if you or someone you know has symptoms of borderline personality disorder. It is especially important to seek help right away if you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide.</p>
