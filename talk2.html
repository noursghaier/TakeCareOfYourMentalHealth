          <h1>For Young People Looking for Help </h1>
          <br>
          <p>If you have, or believe you may have, mental health problem, it can be helpful to talk about these issues with others. It can be scary to reach out for help, but it is often the first step to helping you heal, grow, and recover.</p>   
       <p>Mental health problems don't only affect adults. Children, teens and young adults can have mental health problems, too. In fact, three out of four people with mental health problems showed signs before they were 24 years old.</p>
       
       <h2 >What Does “Mental Health Problem” Mean?  </h2>
        <p>Are you having trouble doing the things you like to do or need to do because of how you feel—like going to school, work or hanging out with friends?</p>
        <p>Are you having a rough day? Have you been feeling down for a while? Everyone goes through tough times, and no matter how long you've had something on your mind, it's important that you talk to someone about it.</p>
       <p>
            Talk to your parents or a trusted adult if you experience any of these things:
            <ul>
                <li>Can't eat or sleep</li>
                <li>Can't perform daily tasks like going to school</li>
                <li>Don't want to hang out with your friends or family</li>
                <li>Don't want to do things you usually enjoy</li>
                <li>Fight a lot with family and friends</li>
                <li>Feel like you can't control your emotions and it's affecting your relationships with your family and friends</li>
                <li>Have low or no energy</li>
                <li>Feel hopeless</li>
                <li>Feel numb or like nothing matters</li>
                <li>Can't stop thinking about certain things or memories</li>
                <li>Feel confused, forgetful, edgy, angry, upset, worried, or scared</li>
                <li>Want to harm yourself or others</li>
                <li>Have random aches and pains</li>
                <li>Smoke, drink, or use drugs</li>
                <li>Hear voices</li>
            </ul>
       </p>
       <h2>Where Can I Get Help?</h2>
       <p>You are not alone. Lots of people have been where you are or are there right now. But there are also lots of people who want to help you.</p>
       <p>
            Another way to get help is by talking to someone you trust. This could be a parent, family member, teacher, school counselor, spiritual leader or another trusted adult, who:
         <ul>
             <li>Gives good advice when you want and ask for it</li>
             <li>Respects your need for privacy so you can tell him or her anything</li>
             <li>Lets you talk freely about your feelings and emotions without judging, teasing, or criticizing</li>
             <li>Helps you figure out what to do the next time a difficult situation comes up</li>
         </ul>
