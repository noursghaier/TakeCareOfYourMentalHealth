        <h2 id="depression"> Depression   </h2>
        <p>
          Depression is a serious medical illness that involves the brain. It's more than just a feeling of being "down in the dumps" or "blue" for a few days. If you are one of the more than 20 million people in the United States who have depression, the feelings do not go away. They persist and interfere with your everyday life. Symptoms can include:
                 <ul >
                   <li>Sadness</li>
                   <li>Loss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy</li>
                   <li>Change in weight</li>
                   <li>Difficulty sleeping or oversleeping</li>
                   <li>Energy loss</li>
                   <li>Feelings of worthlessness</li>
                   <li>Thoughts of death or suicide</li>

                 </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Depression is a disorder of the brain. There are a variety of causes, including genetic, environmental, psychological, and biochemical factors. Depression usually starts between the ages of 15 and 30, and is much more common in women. Women can also get postpartum depression after the birth of a baby. Some people get seasonal affective disorder in the winter. Depression is one part of bipolar disorder.  </p>       
        <p> There are effective treatments for depression, including antidepressants and talk therapy. Most people do best by using both. </p>
       
        <h2 id="bipolardisorder">Bipolar Disorder</h2>
        <p>Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness. People who have it go through unusual mood changes. They go from very happy, "up," and active to very sad and hopeless, "down," and inactive, and then back again. They often have normal moods in between. The up feeling is called mania. The down feeling is depression.</p>
        <p>The causes of bipolar disorder aren't always clear. It runs in families. Abnormal brain structure and function may also play a role.</p>
        <p>Bipolar disorder often starts in a person's late teen or early adult years. But children and adults can have bipolar disorder too. The illness usually lasts a lifetime.</p>
        <p>If you think you may have it, tell your health care provider. A medical checkup can rule out other illnesses that might cause your mood changes.</p>
        <p>If not treated, bipolar disorder can lead to damaged relationships, poor job or school performance, and even suicide. However, there are effective treatments to control symptoms: medicine and talk therapy. A combination usually works best.</p>
   
      <h2 id="seasonal">Seasonal Affective Disorder  </h2>
      <p>Some people experience a serious mood change during the winter months, when there is less natural sunlight. This condition is called seasonal affective disorder, or SAD. SAD is a type of depression. It usually lifts during spring and summer.</p>
      <p>
          Not everyone with SAD has the same symptoms. They include
          <ul>
            <li>Sad, anxious or "empty" feelings</li>
            <li>Feelings of hopelessness and/or pessimism</li>
            <li>Feelings of guilt, worthlessness or helplessness</li>
            <li>Irritability, restlessness</li>
            <li>Loss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy</li>
            <li>Fatigue and decreased energy</li>
            <li>Difficulty concentrating, remembering details and making decisions</li>
            <li>Difficulty sleeping or oversleeping</li>
            <li>Changes in weight</li>
            <li>Thoughts of death or suicide</li>

          </ul>

      </p>
      <p>SAD may be effectively treated with light therapy. But nearly half of people with SAD do not respond to light therapy alone. Antidepressant medicines and talk therapy can reduce SAD symptoms, either alone or combined with light therapy.</p>
        
      <h2 id="self">Self-Harm</h2>
      <p>Self-harm refers to a person's harming their own body on purpose. About 1 in 100 people hurts himself or herself in this way. More females hurt themselves than males. A person who self-harms usually does not mean to kill himself or herself. But they are at higher risk of attempting suicide if they do not get help.</p>
      <p>Self-harm tends to begin in teen or early adult years. Some people may engage in self-harm a few times and then stop. Others engage in it more often and have trouble stopping.</p>
      <p>Examples of self-harm include:
         <ul>
          <li>Cutting yourself (such as using a razor blade, knife, or other sharp object to cut the skin)</li>
          <li>Punching yourself or punching things (like a wall)</li>
          <li>Burning yourself with cigarettes, matches, or candles</li>
          <li>Pulling out your hair</li>
          <li>Poking objects through body openings</li>
          <li>Breaking your bones or bruising yourself</li>

         </ul>
         Many people cut themselves because it gives them a sense of relief. Some people use cutting as a means to cope with a problem. Some teens say that when they hurt themselves, they are trying to stop feeling lonely, angry, or hopeless.
      </p>
      <p>It is possible to overcome the urge to hurt yourself. There are other ways to find relief and cope with your emotions. Counseling may help.</p>
