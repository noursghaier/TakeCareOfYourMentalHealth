          <h1>For Friends and Family Members </h1>
          <br>
          <p>Anyone can experience mental health problems. Friends and family can make all the difference in a person's recovery process.</p>
      <h2>Supporting a Friend or Family Member with Mental Health Problems</h2>
      <p>You can help your friend or family member by recognizing the signs of mental health problems and connecting them to professional help.</p>
     <p>
            Talking to friends and family about mental health problems can be an opportunity to provide information, support, and guidance. Learning about mental health issues can lead to:
        <ul>
            <li>Improved recognition of early signs of mental health problems</li>
            <li>Earlier treatment</li>
            <li>Greater understanding and compassion</li>
        </ul>
     </p>
     <p>
            If a friend or family member is showing <b> <a href="basics1.html#signs"> signs of a mental health problem </a></b>or reaching out to you for help, offer support by:
       <ul>
           <li>Finding out if the person is getting the care that he or she needs and wants—if not, connect him or her to help</li>
           <li>Expressing your concern and support</li>
           <li>Reminding your friend or family member that help is available and that mental health problems can be treated</li>
           <li>Asking questions, listening to ideas, and being responsive when the topic of mental health problems come up</li>
           <li>Reassuring your friend or family member that you care about him or her</li>
           <li>Offering to help your friend or family member with everyday tasks</li>
           <li>Including your friend or family member in your plans—continue to invite him or her without being overbearing, even if your friend or family member resists your invitations</li>
           <li>Educating other people so they understand the facts about mental health problems and do not discriminate</li>
           <li>Treating people with mental health problems with respect, compassion, and empathy</li>
       </ul>
        </p>
   <h2>How to Talk About Mental Health</h2>
   <p>
        Do you need help starting a conversation about mental health? Try leading with these questions and make sure to actively listen to your friend or family member's response.
     <ul>
         <li>I've been worried about you. Can we talk about what you are experiencing? If not, who are you comfortable talking to?</li>
         <li>What can I do to help you to talk about issues with your parents or someone else who is responsible and cares about you?</li>
         <li>What else can I help you with?</li>
         <li>I am someone who cares and wants to listen. What do you want me to know about how you are feeling?</li>
         <li>Who or what has helped you deal with similar issues in the past?</li>
         <li>Sometimes talking to someone who has dealt with a similar experience helps. Do you know of others who have experienced these types of problems who you can talk with?</li>
         <li>It seems like you are going through a difficult time. How can I help you to find help?</li>
         <li>How can I help you find more information about mental health problems?</li>
         <li>I'm concerned about your safety. Have you thought about harming yourself or others?</li>
     </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
            When talking about mental health problems:
        <ul>
            <li>Know how to connect people to help</li>
            <li>Communicate in a straightforward manner</li>
            <li>Speak at a level appropriate to a person's age and development level (preschool children need fewer details as compared to teenagers)</li>
            <li>Discuss the topic when and where the person feels safe and comfortable</li>
            <li>Watch for reactions during the discussion and slow down or back up if the person becomes confused or looks upset</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Sometimes it is helpful to make a comparison to a physical illness. For example, many people get sick with a cold or the flu, but only a few get really sick with something serious like pneumonia. People who have a cold are usually able to do their normal activities. However, if they get pneumonia, they will have to take medicine and may have to go to the hospital.</p>
    <p>Similarly, feelings of sadness, anxiety, worry, irritability, or sleep problems are common for most people. However, when these feelings get very intense, last for a long period of time, and begin to interfere with school, work, and relationships, it may be a sign of a mental health problem. And just like people need to take medicine and get professional help for physical conditions, someone with a mental health problem may need to take medicine and/or participate in therapy in order to get better.</p>
